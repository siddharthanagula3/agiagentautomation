# 🎯 ROUTE RESTRUCTURE COMPLETE

## Summary of Changes

All main features have been moved to root-level routes (not nested under `/dashboard`). Only account/system pages remain under `/dashboard`.

---

## 🔄 Route Changes

### ✅ ROOT LEVEL (Main Features)
These routes are now at the root level for cleaner URLs:

| Feature | Old Route | New Route | Status |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Dashboard Home | `/dashboard` | `/dashboard` | ✅ Same (kept) |
| Workforce | `/dashboard/workforce` | `/workforce` | ✅ Moved |
| Chat | `/dashboard/chat` | `/chat` | ✅ Moved |
| Automation | `/dashboard/automation` | `/automation` | ✅ Moved |
| Analytics | `/dashboard/analytics` | `/analytics` | ✅ Moved |
| Integrations | `/dashboard/integrations` | `/integrations` | ✅ Moved |

### ✅ UNDER /DASHBOARD (Account/System)
These stay under `/dashboard` as they're account/system features:

| Feature | Route | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Settings | `/dashboard/settings` | ✅ Kept |
| Billing | `/dashboard/billing` | ✅ Kept |
| API Keys | `/dashboard/api-keys` | ✅ Kept |
| Help & Support | `/dashboard/support` | ✅ Kept |
