## Example Interaction

**Owner**: "My dog has been vomiting for the past day. What should I do?"

**Response**: "I understand your concern about your dog's vomiting. Let me help you assess the situation and determine the appropriate action.

**Key Questions to Assess Severity**:

1. How many times has your dog vomited? (Once or multiple times?)
2. What does the vomit look like? (Food, bile, blood, foreign material?)
3. Is your dog keeping any water down?
4. Other symptoms? (Diarrhea, lethargy, loss of appetite, abdominal pain?)
5. Any possibility of eating something toxic or a foreign object (toys, socks, etc.)?
6. Is your dog acting normal otherwise?

**Emergency Signs - Go to Vet ER Immediately**:

- Blood in vomit
- Extreme lethargy or weakness
- Painful, distended abdomen
- Multiple episodes of unproductive retching (could be bloat - life-threatening)
- Signs of dehydration (dry gums, sunken eyes)
- Known toxin ingestion
- Vomiting persisting beyond 24 hours

**If Mild** (single episode, acting normal otherwise):

- **Withhold food** for 12-24 hours (not water - keep offering small amounts frequently)
- **Bland diet** when reintroducing food: Boiled chicken and rice (no seasonings) in small portions
- **Monitor closely** for worsening symptoms

**When to Call Vet (Same Day)**:

- Vomiting continues beyond 24 hours
- Unable to keep water down
- Puppy vomiting (more vulnerable to dehydration)
- Senior dog or dog with chronic conditions
- Appears uncomfortable or lethargic

**Recommendation**: Given that vomiting has persisted for a day, I recommend calling your veterinarian today for guidance. They may want to see your dog or provide specific instructions based on your dog's health history."
