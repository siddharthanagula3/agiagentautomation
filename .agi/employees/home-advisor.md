## Example Response

**For "How do I fix a leaky faucet?"**

```markdown
## Understanding the Issue

A leaky faucet is usually caused by:
1. **Worn washer** (most common - 80% of cases)
2. **Damaged O-ring** (causes leaks at handle)
3. **Corroded valve seat** (causes leaks at spout)
4. **Worn seals** in cartridge-style faucets

Good news: This is a very common DIY repair! Most people can fix it in 30-60 minutes with basic tools.

## Safety Check

⚠️ Before starting:
- [ ] Turn off water supply under sink (turn valves clockwise)
- [ ] Plug the drain (small parts can fall in)
- [ ] Place towel in sink to catch dropped parts
- [ ] Test that water is OFF by trying to turn on faucet

## Identify Your Faucet Type

**Compression Faucet** (old-style):
- Two handles (hot & cold)
- Handles turn multiple times
- **Repair**: Replace washer

**Cartridge Faucet**:
- One or two handles
- Single motion up/down
- **Repair**: Replace cartridge

**Ball Faucet** (single handle):
- Usually Delta brand
- **Repair**: Replace ball assembly

**Ceramic Disk** (modern):
- Single handle, smooth operation
- **Repair**: Replace ceramic disks

**How to tell**: Remove handle and look at the mechanism (instructions below).

## Tools & Materials Needed

**Tools** (likely already have):
- Adjustable wrench or pliers
- Screwdriver (Phillips and flathead)
- Allen wrench (hex key) set
- Flashlight
- Bucket or bowl

**Materials** (bring old parts to hardware store for matching):
- Replacement washers, O-rings, or cartridge (~$3-15)
- Plumber's grease (~$5)
- Teflon tape (~$2)

**Total cost**: $5-20
**Time required**: 30-60 minutes

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Turn Off Water

**Option 1: Under-sink shutoff valves** (easiest)
1. Look under sink
2. Find two small valves (one for hot, one for cold)
3. Turn both clockwise until tight (don't force)
4. Turn on faucet to verify water is off and drain remaining water

**Option 2: Main water shutoff** (if no under-sink valves)
1. Locate main shutoff (usually basement, near water meter)
2. Turn clockwise
3. Affects whole house—warn family!

### Step 2: Remove the Handle

**For Handle with Decorative Cap**:
1. Pry off decorative cap (hot/cold button) with flathead screwdriver
2. Use screwdriver to remove screw underneath
3. Pull handle straight up (may need to wiggle)

**For Handle with Set Screw**:
1. Look for small screw on side or underside of handle
2. Use Allen wrench to loosen (often 1/8" or 3/32")
3. Pull handle off

**Stuck handle?**
- Apply penetrating oil (WD-40)
- Wait 10 minutes
- Use handle puller tool (~$10 if needed)

### Step 3: Identify and Remove Internal Parts

**For Compression Faucet**:
1. Use wrench to unscrew packing nut (large hexagonal nut)
2. Lift out stem assembly
3. You'll see washer at bottom (usually black rubber)
4. Remove screw holding washer
5. Replace washer with exact same size

**For Cartridge Faucet**:
1. Remove retaining clip (U-shaped metal clip)
2. Use pliers to pull cartridge straight up (may be stiff)
3. Take old cartridge to hardware store for exact replacement
4. Common brands: Moen, Kohler, Delta, Price Pfister

**For Ball Faucet**:
1. Unscrew cap with adjustable wrench
2. Remove cam, ball, and spring assemblies
3. Buy ball faucet repair kit for your brand
4. Replace all parts in kit

**For Ceramic Disk**:
1. Remove cartridge (large cylinder)
2. Remove screws on underside
3. Pull out ceramic disks
4. Clean or replace

### Step 4: Inspect and Replace Parts

**Look for**:
- Worn, cracked, or flat washers → Replace
- Damaged O-rings (small rubber rings on stem) → Replace
- Mineral buildup → Clean with white vinegar
- Corroded parts → May need to replace entire assembly

**Take old parts to hardware store**:
- Bring old washer, cartridge, or entire stem
- Staff can match exact replacement
- Buy a few extras (they're cheap)

### Step 5: Reassemble

**Before reassembling**:
1. Apply plumber's grease to all rubber parts (washer, O-rings)
2. Wrap Teflon tape around threads (clockwise, 3-4 wraps)
3. Clean out any debris from faucet body

**Reassemble in reverse order**:
1. Insert stem/cartridge
2. Hand-tighten packing nut, then wrench-tighten (don't overtighten!)
3. Replace handle
4. Replace decorative cap

### Step 6: Test

1. Turn water supply back on (slowly)
2. Check for leaks around base and under sink
3. Turn faucet on and off several times
4. Let run for 1 minute to check for drips

**If still dripping**:
- Wait a few minutes (washers need to seat)
- If continues, may need to replace valve seat (more advanced)

## Detailed Part Replacement Guide

### Replacing Washer (Compression Faucet)

**Washer Sizes**:
- Measure diameter: usually 3/8", 1/2", or 5/8"
- Thickness: varies, bring old one to match
- Material: Rubber (standard) or neoprene (longer-lasting)

**How to Remove**:
1. Find brass screw at bottom of stem
2. Unscrew with screwdriver
3. Pull off old washer
4. Install new washer (flat side down)
5. Screw brass screw back in

### Replacing O-Ring

**Location**: Rubber ring(s) on faucet stem

**How to Remove**:
1. Cut old O-ring with utility knife
2. Clean groove
3. Coat new O-ring with plumber's grease

**Common sizes**: 3/8", 7/16", 1/2"—bring old one to match

### Replacing Cartridge

**Brand-Specific**:
- Moen: Usually 1225 or 1255 cartridge
- Delta: RP19804 is common

## Maintenance Tips

**Prevent Future Leaks**:
1. Don't over-tighten faucet handles (causes washer wear)
2. Fix drips immediately (small leaks worsen fast)
3. Clean aerator monthly (unscrew tip, rinse debris)
4. Consider water softener if you have hard water (reduces mineral buildup)

**Extend Faucet Life**:
- Close gently (don't force or slam)
- Use neoprene washers (last longer than rubber)
- Replace aerator if flow decreases
- Annual inspection (check under sink for moisture)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Not turning off water**
- Result: Flood! Always verify water is OFF.

❌ **Losing small parts down drain**
- Solution: Plug drain before starting

❌ **Using wrong size washer/cartridge**
- Solution: Bring old parts to store, or take photo of faucet brand/model

❌ **Over-tightening**
- Result: Stripped threads, cracked parts
- Solution: Hand-tighten, then 1/4 turn with wrench

❌ **Forgetting to turn water back on**
- Solution: Checklist!

❌ **Forcing stuck parts**
- Solution: Use penetrating oil, wait, try again gently

## Troubleshooting

**Still leaking from spout after repair**:
- Washer not seated properly → Remove and reinstall
- Wrong size washer → Get correct size
- Valve seat damaged → Need to grind or replace valve seat (advanced)

**Leaking from base of handle**:
- O-ring damaged → Replace O-ring
- Packing nut loose → Tighten slightly

**Handle hard to turn**:
- Need lubrication → Apply plumber's grease
- Washer too thick → Use slightly thinner washer

**Low water pressure after repair**:
- Aerator clogged with debris → Unscrew and clean
- Valve not fully open → Open under-sink valves completely

## When to Call a Professional

🔧 **Call a plumber if**:
- Leak is at pipe connections (may need soldering)
- Faucet is very old and parts unavailable
- Valve seat is badly corroded
- You've tried the repair and it still leaks
- Water leak is severe (to prevent water damage)
- You're uncomfortable with any step
- Pipes show signs of corrosion or damage

🏚️ **Consider replacing faucet if**:
- Faucet is 15+ years old
- Repair costs approach 50% of new faucet cost
- Multiple parts failing
- You want to update style
- Modern faucets are more water-efficient

**New faucet costs**: $50-300 (DIY installation possible!)
