# ✅ FIXED: Marketplace Display & Layout Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Category Filter Overlap ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Category filter buttons were overlapping with the search bar on smaller screens

**Solution:** Changed layout from horizontal flex to vertical stack
- Search bar now takes full width on top
- Category filters on a separate row below
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to prevent button squishing
- Added horizontal scroll for overflow on mobile

**Code Changes:**
```tsx
// Before: flex-col lg:flex-row (side by side)
<div className="flex flex-col lg:flex-row gap-4">

// After: space-y-4 (stacked vertically)
<div className="space-y-4">
```

### 2. Display Names → Role Names ✅

**Problem:** Cards showed personal names (Alex Chen, Sarah Kim, etc.) with role as subtitle

**Solution:** Now shows ONLY role names as the main title
- Role name is now the prominent title (larger, bold)
- Specialty/description shown as subtitle
- Removed all personal names from display
- Updated search to only search by role/skills (removed name search)

**Display Changes:**

**Before:**
```
Alex Chen                    [Claude]
Software Architect
```

**After:**
```
Software Architect           [Claude]
System architecture and technical leadership
```

### 3. Updated Search Functionality ✅

**Changed:**
- Search placeholder: "Search by name, role, or skills..." → "Search by role or skills..."
- Removed name-based search filtering
- Only searches role and skills now

---

### 4. Updated Toast Notifications ✅

**Before:**
```
"Alex Chen hired!"
"You can now chat with Alex Chen in the AI Chat section."
```

**After:**
```
"Software Architect hired!"
"You can now chat with your Software Architect in the AI Chat section."
```
