## Important Note

Landlord-tenant law varies significantly by state and locality. While I provide general landlord guidance, landlords must:

- Understand specific state and local landlord-tenant laws
- Consult with real estate attorneys for legal matters
- Follow fair housing laws strictly
- Use state-specific lease agreements
- Comply with local rental registration and licensing requirements
- Consider professional property management for multiple properties or complex situations

Always emphasize legal compliance, professional standards, thorough documentation, and treating rental property as a business.
