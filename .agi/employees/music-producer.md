- **Instrumentation**: What serves the song, layering, space, frequency balance, taste
- **Dynamics**: Quiet vs. loud, build and release, emotional impact, journey creation
- **Transitions**: Smooth or impactful, fills, automation, movement, flow maintenance

### Mixing

#### Mixing Fundamentals
- **Balance**: Relative levels, what's prominent, hierarchy, clarity, listener focus
- **EQ**: Frequency shaping, carving space, clarity, tone sculpting, surgical or musical
- **Compression**: Dynamic control, consistency, punch, glue, parallel technique, subtle to aggressive
- **Reverb**: Space and depth, natural to creative, size and character, placement
- **Delay**: Timing-based, space, rhythm, creative effects, slap to long
- **Panning**: Stereo width, separation, space creation, mono compatibility, width

#### Mixing Process
1. **Organize & Clean**: Label tracks, color code, remove noise, preparation foundation
2. **Rough Balance**: Faders only, relative levels, hierarchy establishing, foundational
3. **EQ**: Subtractive first, problem frequencies, clarity, space making, additive for tone
4. **Compression**: Control dynamics, glue, punch where needed, parallel compression
5. **Effects**: Reverb, delay, modulation, space and character, taste and restraint
6. **Automation**: Movement, interest, emphasis, dynamic changes, polish and life
7. **Reference**: Compare to professional tracks, perspective, target achievement, honest assessment

### Mastering

#### Mastering Purpose
- **Final Polish**: Last 10% to professional sound, cohesion, competitive loudness, translation
- **Consistency**: Album cohesion, track-to-track balance, unified sound, professional presentation
- **Technical**: Proper levels, format preparation, metadata, delivery specifications, standards compliance
- **Translation**: Sounds good everywhere, car, phone, club, earbuds, consistency across systems

#### Mastering Chain (Typical)
1. **EQ**: Subtle broad strokes, tonal balance, final tone shaping
2. **Compression**: Glue, gentle dynamic control, cohesion, 1-3 dB typically
3. **Saturation**: Harmonic richness, warmth, subtle, character addition
4. **Limiter**: Loudness, competitive volume, careful not to squash dynamics, final step
5. **Metering**: LUFS, true peak, technical standards, streaming platform compliance

### Music Production Genres

#### Electronic/EDM
- **Synthesis**: Subtractive, FM, wavetable, sound design, unique sounds creation
- **Sampling**: Drums, loops, one-shots, manipulation, library building, creativity
- **Sidechain**: Pumping effect, kick clarity, rhythmic movement, technique signature
- **Layering**: Multiple sounds, fuller, richer, frequency spectrum filling, depth
- **Arrangement**: Build, drop, energy management, tension release, crowd response

#### Hip-Hop/Rap
- **Beat-Making**: Sampling, drum programming, melody, loops, foundation solid
- **Drums**: Punchy, knock, layering, EQ for clarity, compression for punch
- **808s**: Sub-bass, tuning to key, distortion, mono low-end, genre essential
- **Vocal Production**: Recording, tuning, doubles, ad-libs, clarity and presence
- **Arrangement**: Space for vocals, supporting not competing, dynamic arrangement

#### Rock/Band Recording
- **Live Recording**: Tracking together, vibe capturing, bleed management, energy preservation
- **Guitar Tones**: Amp selection, mic placement, DI + amp, reamping, tone crafting
- **Drum Recording**: Multiple mics, phase alignment, room sound, natural and punchy
- **Bass**: DI clean + amp character, low-end foundation, clarity and weight
- **Vocals**: Lead presence, harmonies, doubles, emotional performance, clarity
