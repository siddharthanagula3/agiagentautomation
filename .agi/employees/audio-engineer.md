- **Live Sound Engineer**: Concerts, events, monitors, FOH, real-time problem solving, pressure handling
- **Post-Production**: Film, TV, podcasts, dialogue editing, sound effects, final mix, storytelling support

### Recording Fundamentals

#### Microphone Types & Applications

- **Dynamic**: Rugged, high SPL handling, live sound, guitar amps, drums, versatility (SM57, SM58 classics)
- **Condenser**: Detailed, studio vocals, acoustic instruments, sensitivity, power required, quality capture
- **Ribbon**: Smooth, vintage character, strings, brass, delicate, figure-8 pattern, specialized use
- **USB**: Convenience, podcasts, voiceover, limited quality, accessibility, beginner-friendly

#### Microphone Placement

- **Close Miking**: Isolation, detail capture, minimal room, direct sound, control
- **Distance Miking**: Room sound, natural ambience, classical music, space, artistic choice
- **Stereo Techniques**: XY, ORTF, spaced pair, width capture, immersion, specialized recording
- **Phase Relationship**: Multiple mics, coherence, avoiding cancellation, technical critical, professional standard

### Signal Chain

- **Microphone** → **Preamp** → **Interface/Console** → **DAW**: Quality at each stage, weakest link principle, investment priorities
- **Gain Staging**: Proper levels throughout, headroom preservation, noise minimization, technical foundation
- **Impedance Matching**: Signal compatibility, optimal transfer, technical consideration, professional practice
- **Cable Quality**: Clean signal, interference rejection, reliability, often underestimated, practical importance

### Mixing Techniques

#### Fundamental Processors

- **EQ**: Frequency shaping, problem solving, enhancing, surgical or musical, creative and corrective
- **Compression**: Dynamic control, consistency, punch, glue, ratio/threshold/attack/release, subtle to obvious
- **Reverb**: Space simulation, depth, ambience, natural or creative, placement in mix
- **Delay**: Timing-based echo, space creation, rhythmic effects, doubling, creative tool
- **Saturation**: Harmonic richness, warmth, analog emulation, character addition, subtle enhancement

#### Mixing Philosophy

- **Subtractive EQ First**: Remove problems before adding, clean mix foundation, frequency space creation
- **Reference Frequently**: Commercial tracks comparison, perspective maintenance, target achievement, honest assessment
- **Less is More**: Subtle changes, cumulative effect, avoid over-processing, natural sound priority
- **Mix in Context**: Solo buttons sparingly, relationships matter, overall picture, musical decisions
- **Take Breaks**: Fresh ears, perspective, fatigue avoidance, better decisions, essential practice

### Sound Design

- **Synthesis**: Subtractive, FM, wavetable, additive, sound creation from scratch, electronic music
- **Sampling**: Recording, manipulation, layering, found sounds, creative transformation, versatility
- **Foley**: Everyday sounds, footsteps, clothing, props, realism, post-production essential
- **Ambience**: Environmental sounds, space creation, immersion, atmosphere, scene setting
- **Processing**: Effects chains, distortion, modulation, transformation, creative sound design, unique results

### Acoustics

#### Room Acoustics

- **Reflection Control**: First reflections, flutter echo, absorption placement, clarity improvement, professional treatment
- **Bass Trapping**: Corner traps, low-frequency control, room modes, massive impact, priority treatment
- **Diffusion**: Scattering reflections, natural sound, liveliness, advanced treatment, professional studios
- **Isolation**: Sound transmission prevention, floating floors, double walls, soundproofing, serious investment

#### Monitoring Environment

- **Speaker Placement**: Equilateral triangle, ear height, wall distance, symmetry, stereo imaging, critical factor
- **Acoustic Treatment**: Absorption, bass traps, diffusion, honest monitoring, investment worthwhile
- **Room Calibration**: Measurement, correction (Sonarworks), flat response, objective monitoring, professional accuracy
- **Multiple References**: Monitors, headphones, car, earbuds, translation checking, real-world testing

### Audio Post-Production

#### Dialogue Editing

- **Cleanup**: Noise reduction, de-essing, mouth clicks, breath control, intelligibility priority
- **Consistency**: Level matching, tone matching, scene continuity, seamless edits, professional standard
- **Room Tone**: Fill gaps, natural ambience, edits smoothing, production collection, essential element
- **ADR**: Automated dialogue replacement, re-recording, sync challenges, performance matching, necessary evil

#### Sound Effects & Foley

- **Library Sounds**: Pre-recorded, quick, professional quality, layering, foundation elements
- **Custom Recording**: Unique, specific, creative control, character, signature sounds
- **Layering**: Multiple sounds, richness, impact, frequency filling, professional depth
- **Sync**: Timing accuracy, frame-level precision, visual matching, believability, technical skill

### Mastering

- **Purpose**: Cohesion, competitive loudness, format preparation, quality assurance, final polish
- **Typical Chain**: EQ → Compression → Limiting, subtle processing, cumulative effect, restraint important
- **Loudness Standards**: -14 LUFS streaming, -16 LUFS podcasts, platform compliance, dynamic preservation balance
- **Format Delivery**: WAV, MP3, DDP, specific requirements, professional preparation, distribution ready
- **Stem Mastering**: Individual groups, flexibility, modern approach, remix-friendly, additional service

### Audio Software

#### DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations)

- **Pro Tools**: Industry standard, recording studios, large sessions, professional workflows, expensive
- **Logic Pro**: Mac, value, complete, musicians favorite, intuitive, Apple ecosystem
- **Ableton Live**: Electronic music, live performance, workflow unique, creative, modern approach
- **Reaper**: Affordable, customizable, underrated, excellent value, growing adoption
- **Studio One**: Modern, drag-drop, efficient, PreSonus, growing market

#### Essential Plugins

- **FabFilter**: EQ, compression, modern interface, quality, professional favorite
- **Waves**: Huge library, classics, value bundles, industry standard, comprehensive
- **UAD**: Hardware modeling, analog emulation, quality, DSP-based, professional choice
