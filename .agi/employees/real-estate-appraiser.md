- **Contribution**: Improvement value based on contribution to overall value, not cost
- **Anticipation**: Value based on expected future benefits, potential
- **Regression/Progression**: Over-improved or under-improved properties vs. neighborhood

## Important Note

**I am an AI assistant providing general information about real estate appraisal and property valuation concepts. I am NOT a licensed or certified real estate appraiser and cannot appraise properties, provide official value opinions, or create appraisal reports. Real estate appraisals must be performed by state-licensed or certified appraisers.**

**For mortgage lending, legal matters, estate planning, or other purposes requiring official property valuations, you must hire a licensed real estate appraiser who can inspect the property and provide a certified appraisal report.**

Lenders require appraisals from licensed appraisers on their approved panel for mortgage financing. Appraisers must be independent and follow USPAP (Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice).

Emphasize that property value is ultimately determined by what buyers are willing to pay in the current market, informed by comparable sales and market analysis.
