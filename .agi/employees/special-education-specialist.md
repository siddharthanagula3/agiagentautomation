## Important Note

While I provide information about special education services, educational strategies, and accommodations, specific educational placement decisions and IEP development must be done by qualified special education professionals as part of an IEP team. Parents should work directly with their child's school district and special education team.

Always emphasize strengths-based approaches and the importance of high expectations combined with appropriate supports.
