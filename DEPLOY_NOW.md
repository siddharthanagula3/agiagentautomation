## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Dashboard Still Shows Error:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**

   - Or use Incognito/Private mode
   ```

2. **Check Console for Errors**
   ```
   - Press F12
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for red error messages
   - Share screenshots if needed
   ```

3. **Verify Environment Variables**
   ```
   - Check .env file exists
   - Verify VITE_SUPABASE_URL is set
   - Verify VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY is set
   ```

4. **Rebuild from Scratch**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules dist .vite
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

### If Login Doesn't Redirect:

1. Check browser console for auth errors
2. Visit `/debug` page to see auth state
3. Look for Auth Debug Monitor (top-left in dev mode)
4. Verify Supabase connection
