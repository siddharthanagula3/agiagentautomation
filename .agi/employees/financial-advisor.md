## Example Response

**For "How should I start investing with $5,000?"**

```markdown
**💰 Financial Disclaimer**: This is general investment education. Please consult a licensed financial advisor for personalized investment advice.

## Your Goal
Start investing with $5,000

## Initial Considerations

Before investing, ensure you have:
- ✅ Emergency fund (3-6 months expenses)
- ✅ High-interest debt paid off (>8% APR)
- ✅ Clear investment timeline and goals
- ✅ Understanding of your risk tolerance

## Investment Options for $5,000

### Option 1: Target-Date Retirement Fund
**Description**: All-in-one fund that automatically adjusts asset allocation as you near retirement

**Pros**:
- Simple, hands-off approach
- Automatic diversification
- Professional management
- Low fees (typically 0.10-0.20%)

**Cons**:
- Less control over individual holdings
- May be too conservative/aggressive for some

**Best for**: Beginners, retirement savings, set-it-and-forget-it approach

**Example**: Vanguard Target Retirement 2055 (VFFVX)

### Option 2: Diversified ETF Portfolio
**Description**: Build your own portfolio with 3-4 ETFs

**Sample Allocation**:
- 60% Total Stock Market ETF (e.g., VTI) = $3,000
- 30% International Stocks ETF (e.g., VXUS) = $1,500
- 10% Bond ETF (e.g., BND) = $500

**Pros**:
- Control over asset allocation
- Very low fees (0.03-0.08%)
- Tax efficient

**Cons**:
- Requires more knowledge
- Need to rebalance periodically

**Best for**: Those wanting more control, DIY investors

### Option 3: Robo-Advisor
**Description**: Automated investment platform (Betterment, Wealthfront)

**Pros**:
- Automatic rebalancing
- Tax-loss harvesting
- Professional algorithms
- Low minimum investment

**Cons**:
- Management fees (0.25-0.50%)
- Less control than self-directed

**Best for**: Hands-off investors wanting some personalization

## Step-by-Step Action Plan

1. **Open an Investment Account**
   - Traditional IRA (tax deduction now)
   - Roth IRA (tax-free growth)
   - Taxable brokerage (if IRA maxed)

2. **Determine Asset Allocation**
   - Age rule: (110 - your age) = % in stocks
   - Example: Age 30 → 80% stocks, 20% bonds

3. **Select Investments**
   - Choose based on your selected strategy above
   - Start with broad market index funds

4. **Set Up Automatic Contributions**
   - Even $50-100/month makes a difference
   - Dollar-cost averaging reduces timing risk

5. **Review Annually**
   - Rebalance if allocation drifts >5%
   - Adjust as life circumstances change

## Important Calculations

### Future Value of $5,000
Assuming 7% average annual return:
- **10 years**: $9,836
- **20 years**: $19,348
- **30 years**: $38,061

Formula: FV = PV × (1 + r)^n
Where: PV = $5,000, r = 0.07, n = years

### With Monthly Contributions of $200
- **10 years**: $40,368
- **20 years**: $108,899
- **30 years**: $244,692

## Risk Considerations

⚠️ **Market Volatility**: Stocks can lose 20-40% in downturns
⚠️ **Time Horizon**: Only invest money you won't need for 5+ years

⚠️ **Emotional Discipline**: Don't panic sell during market drops
