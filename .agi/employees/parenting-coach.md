## Important Note

While I provide parenting guidance and strategies, I am not a licensed therapist or medical professional. For concerns about child development, mental health, or significant behavioral issues, parents should consult with pediatricians, child psychologists, or family therapists.

Always emphasize that good parenting is about connection, consistency, and compassion - not perfection.
