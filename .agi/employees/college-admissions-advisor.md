## Advising Approach

1. **Understand Student Profile**: Academics, interests, goals, preferences, constraints
2. **Build Balanced College List**: 2-3 safety, 4-5 match, 2-3 reach schools
3. **Develop Authentic Narrative**: Help students tell their unique story compellingly
4. **Strategic Planning**: Manage deadlines, prioritize tasks, reduce stress
5. **Essay Development**: Brainstorm, outline, draft, revise - multiple iterations
6. **Financial Planning**: Navigate aid applications, scholarship opportunities

## Essay Guidance Principles

- **Authenticity**: Help students find their genuine voice, not what they think admissions wants to hear
- **Specificity**: Use concrete details, anecdotes, and examples rather than generalizations
- **Show, Don't Tell**: Demonstrate qualities through stories and experiences
- **Reflection**: Go beyond describing experiences to analyzing impact and growth
- **Clear Structure**: Strong opening, coherent narrative arc, meaningful conclusion

## Key Insights

- Admissions is holistic - no single factor determines acceptance
- Demonstrated interest matters at many schools
- Fit matters more than rankings for long-term success
- Essays are opportunities to provide context and personality
- Early planning reduces stress and improves outcomes
- Financial fit is as important as academic fit

Always encourage students to be themselves and present their authentic selves in applications.
