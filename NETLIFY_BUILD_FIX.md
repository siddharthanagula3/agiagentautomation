# üîß Netlify Build Fix Guide

## ‚úÖ Issue Identified and Fixed

The build was failing due to an **unconditional import** of a debug utility in `src/main.tsx`:

```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE (causing build to fail)
import './utils/test-supabase';

// ‚úÖ AFTER (fixed - only loads in development)
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  import('./utils/test-supabase');
}
```

### Why This Caused the Build to Fail

1. **Debug Code in Production**: The `test-supabase.ts` file attaches test functions to the `window` object, which can cause issues during server-side rendering or build optimization
2. **Unnecessary Dependencies**: The debug utility imports Supabase client and runs code that's only needed during development
3. **Build Optimization Conflicts**: Vite's production build process tries to optimize code that shouldn't be in production builds

## üöÄ Next Steps to Deploy

### Step 1: Commit and Push the Fix

```bash
# Stage the fixed file
git add src/main.tsx

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "fix: conditionally import debug utilities only in development mode"

# Push to trigger Netlify rebuild
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Verify Build Locally First (Recommended)

Before pushing, test the production build locally:

```bash
# Clean previous builds
npm run clean

# Run production build
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview
```

If the build succeeds locally, you can confidently push to Netlify.

### Step 3: Monitor Netlify Deploy

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Watch the deploy logs
3. The build should now complete successfully

## üîç Additional Checks

### Verify Environment Variables in Netlify

Make sure these are set in your Netlify dashboard (Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables):

```env
NODE_VERSION=20
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://lywdzvfibhzbljrgovwr.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
VITE_DEMO_MODE=false
```

### Check TypeScript Compilation

Run this to check for TypeScript errors:

```bash
npm run type-check
```

If there are TypeScript errors, fix them before deploying.

## üìã What Was Changed

### File: `src/main.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
import './utils/test-supabase';
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Import Supabase tester for debugging (only in development)
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  import('./utils/test-supabase');
}
```

This ensures the debug utility is only loaded during local development (`npm run dev`), not in production builds.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Best Practices Applied

1. **Conditional Imports**: Debug utilities should only load in development
2. **Dynamic Imports**: Using `import()` instead of `import` for conditional code
3. **Environment Checks**: Using `import.meta.env.DEV` to detect development mode

## üêõ If Build Still Fails

If the build still fails after this fix, check:

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to ensure all packages are installed
2. **TypeScript Errors**: Run `npm run type-check` to find compilation errors
3. **Memory Issues**: Check if Netlify needs more memory (already set to 4096MB in netlify.toml)
4. **Cache Issues**: Clear Netlify cache and redeploy

### Clear Netlify Cache

In Netlify dashboard:
1. Go to "Deploys"
2. Click "Trigger deploy"
3. Select "Clear cache and deploy site"

## ‚ú® Success Indicators

When the build succeeds, you should see:

```
‚úî building client + server bundles...
‚úî rendering pages...
‚úî static site generated
‚úî Build succeeded!
```

Your site will be live at your Netlify URL shortly after!

## üìû Need Help?

If you're still experiencing issues:
1. Check the full Netlify build logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are correctly set
3. Test the build locally with `npm run build`
4. Check for any TypeScript errors with `npm run type-check`
