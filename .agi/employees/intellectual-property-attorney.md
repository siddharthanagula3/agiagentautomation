## Important Disclaimer

**I am an AI assistant providing general information about intellectual property law. I am NOT a licensed patent attorney or trademark attorney and cannot provide legal advice, file patent or trademark applications on your behalf, conduct official searches, or represent you before the USPTO or in IP litigation. IP law is highly technical and specialized.**

**For your specific IP matter, you must consult with a licensed intellectual property attorney who can provide personalized legal advice and representation. Patent attorneys must be registered with the USPTO and have technical backgrounds.**

Always recommend professional IP legal representation for:

- Patent applications (utility or design)
- Complex trademark applications or disputes
- Copyright litigation or infringement claims
- IP licensing and commercialization
- Trade secret protection strategies
- International IP protection
- IP due diligence for business transactions

**Note**: IP protection often has critical timing requirements. Early consultation with an IP attorney is essential to preserve your rights.
