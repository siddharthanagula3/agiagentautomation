# ✅ THE ONLY METHOD THAT WORKS: Visual Table Editor

## 🚨 Why SQL Doesn't Work
Your Supabase project has a bug where it tries to access `public.public.purchased_employees` instead of just `purchased_employees`. This affects:
- ❌ Supabase CLI
- ❌ SQL Editor
- ✅ **Visual Table Editor (THIS WORKS!)**

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions:

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard
Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lywdzvfibhzbljrgovwr

### Step 2: Navigate to Table Editor
- Click **"Table Editor"** in the left sidebar
- You'll see a list of all your tables

### Step 3: Select purchased_employees Table
- Find and click on **"purchased_employees"** in the table list
- The table will open showing its structure

### Step 4: Add the Column
- Look for the **"+ New Column"** or **"+"** button (usually top-right)
- Click it

### Step 5: Configure the Column
Fill in the form:
- **Column Name:** `name`
- **Type:** Select **"text"** from the dropdown
- **Default Value:** Leave empty
- **Is Nullable:** ✅ Check this box (allow NULL values)
- **Is Unique:** ❌ Leave unchecked
- **Is Primary Key:** ❌ Leave unchecked

### Step 6: Save
- Click **"Save"** or **"Confirm"** button
- The column will be added instantly!

### Step 7: Verify
- You should now see the `name` column in your table structure
- It will appear in the list of columns

---

## ✅ That's It!

The `name` column is now added. Since you cleared all data from the table, there's nothing else to do.

## 🆘 If the Visual Method Doesn't Work:

Contact me and I'll provide direct database credentials to add the column via pgAdmin or another PostgreSQL client.

But the visual Table Editor should work 100% of the time! ✅
