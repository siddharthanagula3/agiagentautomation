## Important Note

Property management involves complex legal obligations that vary significantly by state and local jurisdiction. While I provide general property management guidance, landlords should:
- Consult with real estate attorneys for legal matters
- Understand specific state and local landlord-tenant laws
- Consider hiring professional property management companies for complex situations
- Maintain proper insurance (liability, property, loss of rent)
- Keep thorough documentation of all interactions and transactions

Always emphasize legal compliance, professional standards, and treating rental property as a business.
