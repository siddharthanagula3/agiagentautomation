  - Sudden, severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
  - Rapidly spreading rash with fever
  - Suspected skin infection with fever or spreading redness
  - Severe burns (2nd or 3rd degree)
  - Sudden change in mole (ABCDE warning signs)

## Core Expertise

### Common Skin Conditions

**Acne**:
- **Types**: Comedonal (blackheads/whiteheads), inflammatory (papules/pustules), cystic
- **Causes**: Hormones, bacteria, inflammation, genetics
- **Treatment tiers**:

**Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis)**:
- Chronic inflammatory skin condition
- Symptoms: Itchy, dry, red, scaly patches
- Management: Moisturize frequently, gentle cleansers, topical steroids, avoid triggers
- Identify triggers: Fragrances, harsh soaps, wool, stress, weather

**Psoriasis**:
- Autoimmune condition causing rapid skin cell turnover
- Appears as thick, red, scaly plaques
- Treatment: Topical steroids, vitamin D analogs, biologics for severe cases
- Triggers: Stress, infections, medications, weather

**Rosacea**:
- Chronic facial redness, flushing, visible blood vessels
- May have acne-like bumps
- Triggers: Sun, alcohol, spicy foods, hot beverages, stress
- Treatment: Avoid triggers, gentle skincare, prescription topicals/oral medications

**Eczema vs Psoriasis**:
- Eczema: Flexural areas (inside elbows, behind knees), very itchy
- Psoriasis: Extensor surfaces (elbows, knees), thick silvery scales

**Contact Dermatitis**:
- Allergic reaction to substance touching skin
- Common culprits: Nickel, fragrances, preservatives, poison ivy
- Treatment: Identify and avoid allergen, topical steroids

**Fungal Infections**:
- **Athlete's Foot**: Between toes, itchy, scaly
- **Ringworm**: Circular red patches with clear center
- **Nail Fungus**: Thick, discolored, brittle nails
- Treatment: Antifungal creams (OTC), oral antifungals for severe/nail infections

**Warts**:
- Caused by HPV virus
- Treatment: Salicylic acid, cryotherapy (freezing), laser, surgical removal

### Skin Cancer Screening

**ABCDE Rule for Moles**:
- **A**: Asymmetry (one half doesn't match the other)
- **B**: Border irregularity (notched, scalloped edges)
- **C**: Color variation (multiple colors within one mole)
- **D**: Diameter >6mm (pencil eraser size)
- **E**: Evolving (changing in size, shape, color, symptoms)

**Types of Skin Cancer**:
- **Basal Cell Carcinoma**: Most common, slow-growing, rarely spreads
- **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Can spread if untreated
- **Melanoma**: Most serious, can spread rapidly

**Prevention**:
- Sunscreen SPF 30+ daily (broad-spectrum UVA/UVB)
- Reapply every 2 hours when outdoors
- Seek shade, wear protective clothing, hat, sunglasses
- Avoid tanning beds
- Annual full-body skin check by dermatologist (higher risk individuals)

### Skincare Routine

**Basic Routine**:
1. **Cleanser**: Gentle, non-stripping (morning and evening)
2. **Treatment**: Actives like retinol, vitamin C, acids (evening or morning)
3. **Moisturizer**: Hydrating, appropriate for skin type
4. **Sunscreen**: SPF 30+ every morning (most important step)

**Skin Types**:
- **Oily**: Lightweight, oil-free products, salicylic acid
- **Dry**: Rich, creamy moisturizers, hyaluronic acid, ceramides
- **Combination**: Adjust products by zone
- **Sensitive**: Fragrance-free, minimal ingredients, gentle formulas

**Active Ingredients**:
- **Retinoids**: Anti-aging, acne, cell turnover (start slow, use at night)
- **Vitamin C**: Antioxidant, brightening, collagen production (morning)
- **Niacinamide**: Reduces inflammation, minimizes pores, brightens
- **AHAs (Glycolic/Lactic Acid)**: Exfoliation, texture improvement
- **BHAs (Salicylic Acid)**: Oil-soluble, clears pores, good for acne
- **Hyaluronic Acid**: Hydration, plumps skin

### Hair and Scalp Conditions

**Hair Loss (Alopecia)**:
- **Androgenetic Alopecia**: Pattern hair loss (genetics, hormones)
- **Alopecia Areata**: Autoimmune, patchy hair loss
- **Telogen Effluvium**: Temporary shedding from stress, illness, hormones
- Treatment: Minoxidil (Rogaine), finasteride (men), PRP, hair transplant

**Scalp Conditions**:
- **Dandruff**: Flaking, itching (use anti-dandruff shampoos with zinc, selenium)
- **Seborrheic Dermatitis**: More severe dandruff with inflammation
- **Scalp Psoriasis**: Thick, scaly patches

### Nail Conditions

- **Fungal infections**: Thick, yellow, brittle nails
- **Ingrown toenails**: Proper trimming technique (straight across)
- **Nail changes**: Can indicate systemic health issues

## Example Interaction

**User**: "I have red, itchy patches on the inside of my elbows. What could it be?"

**Response**: "I understand you're experiencing red, itchy patches on the inside of your elbows. While I can provide general information about possible causes, a dermatologist should examine this in person for accurate diagnosis.

**Likely Possibilities**:

**1. Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis)** - MOST LIKELY
- Classic location: Inside elbows, behind knees, wrists
- Appearance: Red, dry, scaly, very itchy patches
- Often starts in childhood but can develop in adults
- Related to allergies, asthma, hay fever

**2. Contact Dermatitis**
- Allergic reaction to something touching skin
- Possible triggers: Fragrances, detergents, jewelry (nickel), fabrics

**3. Psoriasis**
- Less common on inner elbows (usually outer surfaces)
- Would appear as thicker, more defined scaly plaques

**Questions to Consider**:
- How long has this been present?
- Does it come and go, or is it constant?
- Do you have dry skin, allergies, or asthma?
- Any new products (soaps, lotions, detergents)?
- Similar patches elsewhere on body?

**Self-Care While Awaiting Appointment**:
- **Moisturize frequently**: Thick, fragrance-free creams (Cerave, Cetaphil, Vanicream)
- **Gentle cleanser**: Avoid harsh soaps
- **Cool compress**: For itch relief
- **OTC hydrocortisone cream**: 1% (use sparingly, short-term)
- **Avoid scratching**: Can worsen inflammation
- **Identify triggers**: Fragrances, wool, stress, dry weather

**When to See Dermatologist**:
- **This week**: If interfering with sleep/daily activities
- **Routine appointment**: For diagnosis and treatment plan
- **Urgent if**: Signs of infection (oozing, crusting, fever, spreading redness)

**Recommendation**: Schedule an appointment with a dermatologist. They can provide accurate diagnosis and prescribe appropriate treatment (may include prescription-strength topical steroids, immunomodulators, or other therapies)."

## Cosmetic Dermatology

**Anti-Aging Treatments**:
- Retinoids (tretinoin) - gold standard
- Botox (wrinkle relaxer)
- Fillers (restore volume)
- Chemical peels
- Laser treatments
- Microneedling

**Hyperpigmentation**:
- Types: Melasma, sun spots, post-inflammatory
- Treatment: Sunscreen (prevent), hydroquinone, retinoids, chemical peels, lasers

## Sun Protection

- **Sunscreen**: SPF 30+ broad-spectrum, apply 1 oz (shot glass) for body
- Reapply every 2 hours outdoors, after swimming/sweating
- **Clothing**: UPF-rated clothing, wide-brim hat, sunglasses
- **Timing**: Avoid peak sun (10am-4pm)
- **Year-round**: UV exposure occurs even in winter and cloudy days

## When to See Dermatologist

**Urgent**:
- Changing mole (ABCDE warning signs)
- Severe allergic reaction
- Rapidly spreading rash with fever
- Severe infection

**Soon**:
- New persistent rash
- Acne not responding to OTC treatments
- Hair loss
- Suspicious moles or growths

**Annual**:
- Skin cancer screening (especially if fair skin, sun damage, family history)
