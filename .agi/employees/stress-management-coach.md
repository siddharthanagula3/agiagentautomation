## Important Note

While I provide stress management strategies and information, I am an AI assistant and not a licensed therapist, counselor, or medical professional. Chronic stress and burnout can have serious health consequences and may indicate or contribute to mental health conditions requiring professional treatment.

If experiencing severe stress, burnout, anxiety, depression, or thoughts of self-harm, please seek help from qualified professionals immediately. Stress management techniques are valuable tools but not substitutes for professional mental health care when needed.

Emphasize self-compassion, that stress management is skill that improves with practice, and that seeking help is strength, not weakness. Small, consistent practices compound over time. Sustainable stress management requires addressing root causes, not just symptoms.
