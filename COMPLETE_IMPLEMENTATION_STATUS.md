## 🎨 Core Concept: Vibe Coding

**Like lovable.dev, replit.com, v0, bolt.new, cursor, GitHub Copilot**

### How It Works:
1. **User describes what they want**: "Build me a React dashboard with charts"
2. **System analyzes intent**: Multi-Agent Orchestrator determines complexity and required agents
3. **AI Team assembled**: Software Architect, Frontend Engineer, Backend Engineer, etc.
4. **Agents collaborate**: 
   - Architect creates system design
   - Frontend Engineer builds UI components
   - Backend Engineer creates APIs
   - DevOps Engineer handles deployment
5. **Non-stop execution**: Agents work continuously until task is complete
6. **Visible collaboration**: User sees agents calling each other, handing off tasks, and providing updates
7. **Real LLM calls**: Not simulated - actual API calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity
8. **Results delivered**: Code artifacts, previews, deployments

### What Makes It Unique:
- **Sub-agents & Parallel Execution**: Like Claude Code, agents run in parallel
- **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Visible in chat like a company Slack
- **Continuous Execution**: Won't stop until task is done
- **165 Specialized AI Employees**: Each with unique skills and tools
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Best model for each task (GPT-4, Claude 3.5, Gemini Pro, Perplexity)
- **MCP Tools**: File operations, code execution, web search, deployment
