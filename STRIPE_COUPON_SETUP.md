- Use unique codes for different campaigns:
  - `BETATESTER` - General beta users
  - `LAUNCH50` - Launch week users
  - `FRIEND20` - Referral program

## üß™ Test Mode vs Live Mode

### Test Mode (for development):

2. Use test credit cards (4242 4242 4242 4242)
3. No real charges will be made

### Live Mode (for production):
1. Create the same coupon in **Live Mode**
2. Real payments will be processed
3. Make sure to verify the coupon settings!
