## 📋 Manual Action Required

### Enable Leaked Password Protection

**Status**: ⚠️ Currently Disabled  
**Priority**: High (Recommended for Production)  
**Time Required**: 2 minutes

#### What is Leaked Password Protection?

This feature checks user passwords against the [HaveIBeenPwned.org](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) database of compromised passwords. It prevents users from creating accounts with passwords that have been exposed in data breaches.

#### How to Enable

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `agiagentautomation`

2. **Access Authentication Settings**
   - Click on **Authentication** in the left sidebar
   - Click on **Policies** tab
   - Or navigate directly to: **Authentication → Policies**

3. **Enable Password Protection**
   - Find the **"Password Protection"** section
   - Toggle **"Check for leaked passwords"** to **ON**
   - Save changes

#### Screenshots Reference

```
Dashboard → Authentication → Policies
└── Password Protection
    ├── [✅] Check for leaked passwords
    ├── [✅] Minimum password length: 8
    └── [✅] Require uppercase letters
```

#### What This Does

- ✅ Checks new passwords against 600M+ compromised passwords
- ✅ Prevents users from using weak/leaked passwords
- ✅ Enhances account security
- ✅ Complies with security best practices
- ✅ No performance impact on your application

#### Alternative: API Configuration

If you prefer to enable this via API or CLI:

```bash
# Using Supabase CLI
npx supabase --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF \
  secrets set AUTH_ENABLE_HAVEIBEENPWNED=true
```

Or via SQL (if you have direct database access):

```sql
-- This is managed by Supabase Auth service, not the database
-- Must be configured through the dashboard or API
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After enabling leaked password protection, verify your security posture:

### Database Security ✅
- [x] All RLS policies optimized
- [x] All functions have explicit search paths
- [x] All views use SECURITY INVOKER
- [x] All tables have appropriate RLS policies
- [x] No security definer vulnerabilities

### Database Performance ✅
- [x] All foreign keys indexed
- [x] Unused indexes removed
- [x] Composite indexes for common queries
- [x] No auth.uid() re-evaluation issues
- [x] No duplicate indexes

### Authentication Security
- [ ] **Leaked password protection enabled** ← **Action Required**
- [x] RLS enabled on all tables
- [x] Secure password hashing (handled by Supabase)
- [x] Session management configured

---

## 🎯 Optional Enhancements

While not required, these additional security measures are recommended:

### 1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Enable MFA for user accounts:

**Dashboard Path**: Authentication → Policies → Multi-Factor Authentication

**Benefits**:
- Adds extra layer of security
- Protects against password compromise
- Industry best practice

### 2. Rate Limiting

Configure rate limits for authentication endpoints:

**Dashboard Path**: Authentication → Rate Limits

**Recommended Settings**:
- Sign-in attempts: 5 per hour per IP
- Sign-up attempts: 3 per hour per IP
- Password reset: 3 per hour per email

### 3. Email Verification

Ensure email verification is required:

**Dashboard Path**: Authentication → Policies → Email Confirmation

**Setting**: Require email confirmation for new users

### 4. Session Management

Configure session timeouts:

**Dashboard Path**: Authentication → Policies → Session Settings

**Recommended Settings**:
- Session timeout: 7 days
- Refresh token rotation: Enabled
- Reuse interval: 10 seconds
