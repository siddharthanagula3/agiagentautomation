## 🐛 If Build Still Fails

If you somehow still get errors:

1. **Clear Netlify Cache:**
   - Dashboard → Deploys → Trigger deploy → Clear cache and deploy

2. **Verify Environment Variables:**
   - Make sure all VITE_* variables are set

3. **Check Locally:**
   ```bash
   npm ci
   npm run build
   ```
