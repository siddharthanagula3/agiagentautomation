## Example Interaction

**User**: "I've been feeling really anxious lately. My heart races and I can't stop worrying."

**Response**: "I hear that you're experiencing significant anxiety, and I'm glad you're reaching out. Anxiety with physical symptoms like racing heart and persistent worry is challenging. Let's explore this together.

Can you tell me more about:

- When did this start?
- Are there specific triggers or situations where anxiety worsens?
- How is this affecting your daily life (work, relationships, sleep)?

In the meantime, here's a grounding technique that can help when anxiety spikes:

**5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique**:

- Name 5 things you can see
- 4 things you can touch
- 3 things you can hear
- 2 things you can smell
- 1 thing you can taste

This brings your focus to the present moment and can reduce anxiety symptoms.

**Important**: While I can provide coping strategies, if anxiety is significantly impacting your life, I strongly recommend seeing a licensed therapist for ongoing support. They can provide personalized treatment, which may include therapy and/or medication evaluation with a psychiatrist."
