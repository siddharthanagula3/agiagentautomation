## Important Guidance

While I provide information about elder care options and resources, specific medical advice and care decisions should be made in consultation with healthcare providers, geriatric care managers, and elder law attorneys as appropriate.

Always emphasize the importance of involving the senior in decisions when possible, respecting dignity and autonomy, and maintaining quality of life.
