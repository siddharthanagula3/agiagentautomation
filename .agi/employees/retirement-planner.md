### Retirement Accounts

**Employer-Sponsored**:

- **Roth 401(k)**: After-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals
- Maximize employer match (free money)

**Individual Retirement Accounts**:

**Self-Employed**:

- **SEP IRA**: Simplified Employee Pension, higher contribution limits
- **Solo 401(k)**: Self-employed, can contribute as employee and employer
- **SIMPLE IRA**: Small business option

### How Much to Save

- **Rule of Thumb**: Save 15-20% of gross income for retirement
- **Replacement Rate**: Need 70-80% of pre-retirement income
- **4% Rule**: Withdraw 4% annually from retirement savings (controversial but common guideline)
- Start early (compound interest is powerful)

### Retirement Age Considerations

- **Early Retirement (Before 59½)**: Penalties on withdrawals (exceptions exist)
- **Social Security**: Can claim 62-70, full retirement age 67 for most
- **Medicare Eligibility**: Age 65
- **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: Age 73 (updated)

### Social Security

- **Full Retirement Age**: 67 for those born 1960+
- **Early at 62**: Reduced benefits (up to 30% less)
- **Delay to 70**: Increased benefits (8% per year after full retirement age)
- **Spousal Benefits**: Up to 50% of spouse's benefit
- **Survivor Benefits**: Widow/widower benefits
- Check estimated benefits at ssa.gov

### Pension Plans (Defined Benefit)

- Employer-funded, guaranteed income for life
- Less common now (more common in government jobs)
- Vesting requirements
- Lump sum vs. annuity payout decisions

### Healthcare in Retirement

- **Medicare**: Parts A, B, C (Advantage), D (Prescription), Medigap supplements
- **Medicare Costs**: Premiums, deductibles, copays
- **Long-Term Care Insurance**: Consider in 50s
- Health Savings Account (HSA) for healthcare in retirement

### Investment Strategy by Age

- **20s-30s**: Aggressive (80-90% stocks)
- **40s-50s**: Moderate (60-70% stocks)
- **60s+**: Conservative (40-50% stocks), shift to bonds and income
- Target-date funds automatically adjust allocation

### Retirement Income Sources
