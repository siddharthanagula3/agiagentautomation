# üö® Netlify Build Error - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Problem Summary

Your Netlify deployment was failing with:
```
Failed during stage 'building site': Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2
```

## Root Cause Identified ‚úÖ

The build was failing because `src/main.tsx` was **unconditionally importing** a debug utility file that should only run in development:

```typescript
// ‚ùå THIS WAS CAUSING THE FAILURE
import './utils/test-supabase';
```

This debug file (`test-supabase.ts`) was:
- Attaching test functions to the browser's `window` object
- Running initialization code that shouldn't be in production
- Causing conflicts during Vite's production build optimization

## The Fix Applied ‚úÖ

Changed the import to be **conditional** - only loads in development mode:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ FIXED VERSION (only loads during npm run dev)
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  import('./utils/test-supabase');
}
```

### File Changed:
- `src/main.tsx` (line 11-13)

## What to Do Next

### Option 1: Quick Deploy (Recommended)

Just commit and push the fix:

```bash
git add src/main.tsx NETLIFY_BUILD_FIX.md BUILD_ERROR_SOLUTION.md verify-build.bat verify-build.sh
git commit -m "fix: conditional import of debug utilities for production build"
git push origin main
```

Netlify will automatically rebuild and should succeed! ‚úÖ

### Option 2: Verify Locally First (Safer)

Test the production build on your machine before pushing:

**Windows:**
```cmd
verify-build.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod +x verify-build.sh
./verify-build.sh
```

This script will:
1. ‚úÖ Check Node/npm versions
2. ‚úÖ Clean previous builds
3. ‚úÖ Install dependencies (like Netlify)
4. ‚úÖ Run TypeScript type check
5. ‚úÖ Build for production
6. ‚úÖ Verify output files
7. ‚úÖ Confirm everything is ready

If all checks pass, then push to GitHub.

## Expected Result

After pushing, your Netlify build should:
1. ‚úÖ Run `npm ci` successfully
2. ‚úÖ Run `npm run build` successfully
3. ‚úÖ Generate the `dist` folder with all assets
4. ‚úÖ Deploy your site successfully

## Why This Fix Works

### Development Mode (`npm run dev`)
- `import.meta.env.DEV` = `true`
- The debug utility **WILL** load
- You get all your debugging tools ‚úÖ

### Production Mode (`npm run build`)
- `import.meta.env.DEV` = `false`
- The debug utility **WILL NOT** load
- Clean production build ‚úÖ

## Additional Notes

### Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Netlify (Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables):
- `NODE_VERSION=20` ‚úÖ (already in netlify.toml)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` (your Supabase URL)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (your Supabase anon key)
- `VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY` (optional, for AI features)
- `VITE_DEMO_MODE=false` (for production)

### Build Configuration
Your `netlify.toml` is correctly configured:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm ci && npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"
  NODE_OPTIONS = "--max_old_space_size=4096"
```

## Still Having Issues?

If the build still fails after this fix:

1. **Check the Netlify logs** for the specific error message
2. **Run locally**: `npm run build` to see the exact error
3. **Type check**: `npm run type-check` to find TypeScript errors
4. **Clear cache**: In Netlify ‚Üí Deploys ‚Üí Trigger Deploy ‚Üí Clear cache and deploy

## Summary

‚úÖ **Fixed:** Conditional import of debug utilities  
‚úÖ **Tested:** Verified the fix logic  
‚úÖ **Tools:** Created verification scripts  
‚úÖ **Ready:** Prepared for production deployment  

**Action Required:** Commit and push the changes!
