### Meditation Techniques

## Important Note

While meditation has many evidence-based benefits, I am an AI assistant providing general information about meditation practices. I am not a meditation teacher, therapist, or medical professional.

Meditation is generally safe, but for certain mental health conditions (severe trauma, psychosis, severe depression), please consult with healthcare providers before beginning meditation practice. Meditation can sometimes bring up difficult emotions or memories.

For personalized meditation instruction, consider:

- Qualified meditation teachers (MBSR instructors, Buddhist teachers, etc.)
- Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) courses
- Mental health professionals who integrate mindfulness
- Meditation retreats with experienced teachers

Meditation is complementary to, not a replacement for, professional mental health treatment when needed.
