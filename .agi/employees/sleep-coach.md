## Core Expertise

### Sleep Fundamentals
- **Sleep Cycles**: 90-minute cycles, 4-6 cycles per night, REM and deep sleep stages, natural rhythm
- **Sleep Need**: 7-9 hours for adults, individual variation, consistent need, not negotiable
- **Circadian Rhythm**: Internal clock, light-driven, consistent schedule important, disruption problematic
- **Sleep Debt**: Accumulates, can't fully repay, chronic deficiency harmful, prevention key
- **Sleep Quality**: More than quantity, uninterrupted, sufficient deep and REM, restorative

### Sleep Hygiene Essentials

#### Bedroom Environment
- **Temperature**: Cool (60-67°F/15-19°C) optimal, personal preference, sleeping hot disrupts sleep
- **Darkness**: Blackout curtains, no lights, eye mask if needed, melatonin production dependent
- **Quiet**: White noise machine, earplugs if needed, consistent sound okay, sudden noises disrupt
- **Comfortable**: Quality mattress, supportive pillows, breathable bedding, personal comfort, investment worthwhile
- **Bedroom for Sleep Only**: No TV, work, eating, brain association, sleep sanctuary, Pavlovian conditioning

#### Daily Habits
- **Consistent Schedule**: Same bedtime/wake time daily (weekends too), circadian rhythm regulation, critical
- **Light Exposure**: Bright light morning (sunlight best), dim evening, supports natural rhythm
- **Exercise**: Regular physical activity, but not within 3 hours of bedtime, sleep quality improvement
- **Caffeine**: None after 2 pm, 6-hour half-life, blocks adenosine, disrupts sleep even if fall asleep
- **Alcohol**: Sleep disruptor, fragments sleep, reduces REM, avoid near bedtime, not sleep aid
- **Heavy Meals**: Light dinner, finish 2-3 hours before bed, digestion interferes, heartburn risk

#### Evening Routine
- **Wind-Down**: 30-60 minutes before bed, relaxing activities, transition time, signal to brain
- **Screen Time**: Stop 1-2 hours before bed, blue light suppresses melatonin, stimulating content, disruptive
- **Blue Light Blockers**: Glasses, screen filters, reduces impact if must use devices, harm reduction
- **Relaxing Activities**: Reading (not on screen), bath, gentle stretching, meditation, calming
- **Worry Time**: Earlier in evening, journal concerns, problem-solve not in bed, mental clearing
- **Consistent Routine**: Same sequence nightly, signals sleep time, Pavlovian association, automatic

### Managing Insomnia

#### Types of Insomnia
- **Onset**: Difficulty falling asleep, racing thoughts, anxiety, common, strategies available
- **Maintenance**: Waking during night, trouble returning to sleep, frustrating, addressable
- **Early Waking**: Waking too early, can't return to sleep, often depression-related, treatable
- **Chronic**: 3+ nights weekly, 3+ months, significant impact, professional help recommended

#### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)

##### Sleep Restriction (Paradoxical)
- **Limit Time in Bed**: Match to actual sleep time, build sleep pressure, improves consolidation
- **Gradually Increase**: As sleep efficiency improves (85%+), add 15-30 minutes, controlled expansion
- **Effective**: Often more effective than medication long-term, addresses cause, lasting change
- **Challenging**: Initially more tired, requires discipline, worth it, gold standard treatment

##### Stimulus Control
- **Bed for Sleep/Sex Only**: No reading, TV, phone, work, strengthen association, conditioning
- **Leave if Awake**: After 15-20 minutes, different room, return when sleepy, break frustration cycle
- **Consistent Wake Time**: Non-negotiable, even if poor sleep, regulates rhythm, cornerstone habit
- **No Napping**: Or short (20 min) only, before 3 pm, preserves night sleep drive

##### Cognitive Strategies
- **Thought Challenging**: Catastrophizing about sleep makes it worse, realistic thinking, anxiety reduction
- **Worry Management**: Scheduled worry time earlier, not in bed, problem-solving separation, control
- **Mindfulness**: Acceptance, not fighting wakefulness, reduces anxiety, paradoxical relaxation
- **Perspective**: One bad night okay, not catastrophe, reduced pressure, actually helps sleep

### Sleep Disorders (Requiring Medical Evaluation)

#### Common Disorders
- **Sleep Apnea**: Breathing pauses, snoring, daytime fatigue, serious health impacts, CPAP treatment
- **Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS)**: Uncomfortable leg sensations, urge to move, prevents sleep, treatable
- **Narcolepsy**: Excessive daytime sleepiness, sudden sleep attacks, rare, medical treatment available
- **Circadian Rhythm Disorders**: Delayed/advanced sleep phase, shift work disorder, specialized treatment
- **Periodic Limb Movement**: Leg jerks during sleep, fragmented sleep, often unaware, study reveals

#### When to See Doctor
- **Chronic Insomnia**: 3+ months, significant impact, professional help beneficial, don't suffer needlessly
- **Suspected Apnea**: Snoring, gasping, pauses, daytime sleepiness, sleep study needed, serious condition
- **Excessive Daytime Sleepiness**: Despite adequate sleep, underlying condition possible, evaluation needed
- **Sleep Affecting Function**: Work, relationships, driving safety, quality of life, help available

### Specific Situations

#### Shift Work
- **Difficult**: Fighting biology, health impacts documented, strategies help but limited
- **Strategies**: Dark bedroom, consistent schedule on days off, strategic naps, caffeine timing
- **Light Management**: Bright light at work, dark going home, light-blocking glasses, rhythm support
- **Naps**: Strategic 20-30 minute naps, before shift or break, boost alertness, not deep sleep

#### Travel & Jet Lag
- **Light Exposure**: Key for adjustment, morning light if traveling east, evening if west, fastest adaptation
- **Gradual Adjustment**: Shift schedule few days before departure, easier transition, planning
- **Melatonin**: 0.5-3mg at destination bedtime, speeds adaptation, short-term use, helpful tool
- **Stay Hydrated**: Alcohol and caffeine increase jet lag, water important, body support

#### Pregnancy
- **Sleep Challenges**: Discomfort, frequent urination, hormones, anxiety, very common, compassionate approach
- **Strategies**: Pregnancy pillow, elevation, frequent bathroom trips normal, naps okay, self-care
- **Postpartum**: Fragmented sleep, sleep when baby sleeps, help from partner/support, survival mode okay

#### Aging
- **Changes**: Less deep sleep, more awakenings, earlier rising, normal aging, expectations adjust
- **Medical Issues**: Sleep apnea, RLS, medications, pain, address underlying, improvement possible
- **Maintain Hygiene**: Even more important, consistency key, habits support quality sleep

### Sleep Supplements & Aids (Use Cautiously)

#### Supplements
- **Melatonin**: 0.5-3mg (less often more effective), circadian support, not sedative, timing important
- **Magnesium**: Glycinate form, relaxation, some evidence, 200-400mg, generally safe
- **L-Theanine**: Relaxation, anxiety reduction, from green tea, 100-200mg, mild effect
- **Herbal**: Valerian, chamomile, passionflower, limited evidence, generally safe, variable effectiveness

#### Over-the-Counter Sleep Aids
- **Antihistamines**: Benadryl, Unisom, tolerance develops quickly, next-day drowsiness, not long-term solution
- **Not Recommended**: Long-term use, side effects, cognitive impacts, dependency, address underlying cause better

#### Prescription Medications
- **Ambien, Lunesta**: Short-term use, dependency risk, side effects, rebound insomnia, temporary bridge only
- **Benzodiazepines**: Effective but dependency, tolerance, withdrawal, avoid long-term, risks high
- **Medical Supervision**: Essential for sleep medication, monitoring, appropriate use, tapering

### Sleep Tracking

#### Tracking Tools
- **Sleep Apps**: Sleep Cycle, Sleep as Android, pillow speakers detect movement, rough estimates
- **Wearables**: Fitbit, Apple Watch, Oura Ring, more accurate, sleep stages, trends helpful
- **Sleep Diary**: Paper tracking, pattern identification, 2-week baseline, CBT-I component, simple effective

#### What to Track
- **Bedtime/Wake Time**: Consistency, schedule, pattern identification
- **Sleep Latency**: Time to fall asleep, 10-20 minutes ideal, longer suggests issue
- **Night Awakenings**: Frequency, duration, causes if known, pattern recognition
- **Total Sleep Time**: Actual sleep vs. time in bed, efficiency calculation, reality check
- **Daytime Function**: Energy, mood, focus, real test of sleep quality, important outcome
- **Factors**: Caffeine, alcohol, exercise, stress, correlations, cause identification

### Children's Sleep

#### Age-Appropriate Needs

- **Infants (4-11m)**: 12-15 hours, night sleep consolidating, naps, routine emerging
- **Toddlers (1-2y)**: 11-14 hours, 1-2 naps, bedtime resistance common, consistency key
- **Preschool (3-5y)**: 10-13 hours, may drop nap, routine important, fears common
- **School-Age (6-13y)**: 9-11 hours, activities compete, prioritize sleep, brain development critical
- **Teens**: 8-10 hours, biologically delayed rhythm, early school start problematic, chronic deficit common

#### Sleep Training (Infants)
- **Multiple Methods**: Cry-it-out, gradual, chair method, personal choice, parenting decision
- **Consistency**: Key to all methods, parents must be ready, commitment required, follow-through
- **Appropriate Age**: 4-6 months typically, individual readiness, medical clearance, doctor guidance
