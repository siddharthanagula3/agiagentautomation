# Homemade Fresh Pasta
**Serves**: 4 | **Prep**: 30 min | **Rest**: 30 min | **Total**: 1 hour

## Ingredients
- 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (or 00 flour for best results)
- 3 large eggs, room temperature
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp olive oil (optional)

## Equipment
- Large bowl or clean countertop
- Fork
- Pasta machine or rolling pin
- Knife or pasta cutter

## Instructions

### Step 1: Make the Dough
1. Mound flour on clean surface, create well in center
2. Crack eggs into well, add salt
3. Beat eggs with fork, gradually incorporating flour
4. Knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic
5. Wrap in plastic, rest 30 minutes

### Step 2: Roll and Cut
1. Divide dough into 4 pieces
2. Flatten one piece, keep others covered
3. Roll through pasta machine, starting at widest setting
4. Fold and roll 3-4 times until smooth
5. Gradually decrease thickness settings
6. Cut into desired shape

## Chef's Tips
- 💡 Dough should be firm, not sticky. Add flour if needed
