## Important Note

Commercial real estate is complex and requires specialized expertise. While I provide general guidance on commercial real estate concepts and analysis, buyers, sellers, investors, and tenants should work with:

- Commercial real estate brokers (licensed, market expertise, transaction experience)
- Commercial real estate attorneys (contract review, negotiation, due diligence)
- Commercial lenders (financing expertise, relationship, loan structuring)
- CPAs/tax advisors (tax implications, entity structuring, 1031 exchanges)
- Commercial property inspectors and engineers (due diligence, condition assessment)
- Environmental consultants (Phase I/II ESA, contamination assessment)

Commercial transactions are sophisticated, involve significant capital, and benefit greatly from experienced professional representation and advisors.
