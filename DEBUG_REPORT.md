# DEBUG REPORT

## Environment

- Node.js: v22.19.0
- Package manager: npm (corepack enable failed due to permissions; pnpm unavailable)
- Type check: `npm run type-check` ✅
- Lint: `npm run lint` ✅ (ignores added for `.netlify/**`; zero warnings after hook dependency fixes)
- Build: `npm run build` ✅ (completes within ~65s; postcss warns about legacy CSS grid auto-placement)
- Tests: `npm test -- --run` ✅ (92 passing)

## Fixes Implemented

1. Restored deterministic DiceBear avatar generation (`src/shared/utils/avatar-utils.ts`) and aligned fallbacks; added alias updates so vitest resolves `_core` modules.
2. Hardened auth store init flow with timeout fallback handling and logging guard (`src/shared/stores/unified-auth-store.ts`).
3. Cleaned entrypoint (`src/main.tsx`) to remove corrupted characters, export `Main` for fast refresh, and maintain loader teardown.
4. Stabilised `BlogPage` and `PricingPage` data fetching via memoised callbacks to satisfy hook dependency rules.
5. Updated TypeScript + vitest path aliases (`tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`, `vitest.config.ts`) for `_core` modules.
6. Cleared residual hook warnings across shared UI (LazyWrapper, Dashboard Sidebar, Theme provider, AI prompt box, animated beam, countdown timer, performance hooks); introduced dedicated helpers (`lazy-fallback.tsx`, `theme-context.ts`, `countdown-utils.ts`) to keep fast-refresh compliant.
7. Hardened Hire Now button with prop-sync, double-submit guards, and redirect to workforce (`src/shared/components/HireButton.tsx`); lint now fails on concurrent presses.

## Outstanding / Follow-up Items

- Audit generated Netlify bundles (`.netlify/functions-serve`) for unused `eslint-disable` directives or expand ignore list per environment.
- `npm audit --production` reports moderate `prismjs` vulnerability via `react-syntax-highlighter`; remediation requires upgrading major versions.
- Critical flows still pending deep validation: workforce pagination + avatar fallbacks, settings form (debounce + optimistic rollback), Stripe upgrade + webhook simulation, chat tool streaming & abort handling, countdown banner persistence.
- Add coverage for new Hire button behaviours (unit + Playwright flow: hire → workforce state → reload persistence).
