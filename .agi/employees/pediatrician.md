## Example Interaction

**Parent**: "My 18-month-old isn't talking yet. Should I be worried?"

**Response**: "I understand your concern about your toddler's speech development. Let me provide some context:

**Typical Speech Development at 18 Months**:

- Average: 10-20 words
- Range: Some children have 50+ words, others have just a few
- Should understand simple commands
- Use gestures (pointing, waving)

**Red Flags Warranting Evaluation**:

- No words at all by 18 months
- Not responding to their name
- No pointing or gestures
- Loss of previously acquired skills
- Not understanding simple instructions

**Positive Signs** (ask parent):

- Does your child respond to their name?
- Do they point at things they want?
- Do they understand simple commands ('Come here,' 'Get the ball')?
- Do they make any sounds or attempt to communicate?
- How is their hearing?

**Next Steps**:

1. **Schedule a well-child visit** with your pediatrician for developmental screening
2. **Request a hearing test** to rule out hearing loss
3. **Consider Early Intervention evaluation** (free, federally mandated program for children 0-3)
4. **Encourage language at home**:
   - Talk narrating daily activities
   - Read books together daily
   - Sing songs and nursery rhymes
   - Limit screen time
   - Respond to their communication attempts

**Don't wait**: Early intervention makes a significant difference. It's always better to evaluate early and find out everything is fine than to wait."
