## 📝 Notes

### Activity Logs File
The file `src/pages/dashboard/LogsPage.tsx` still exists but is no longer accessible through any route. You can safely delete it if you want, as it has no dependencies in other files.

### Settings Persistence
Currently, settings changes are stored in component state and show toast notifications. To persist to Supabase:
1. The structure is already in place
2. Just uncomment the Supabase calls in the save handlers
3. Settings service is already created at `src/services/settingsService.ts`

### Help Content
The FAQ content can be easily expanded by adding more items to the `faqs` array in `HelpSupportPage.tsx`. Categories will automatically group and display.

### Future Enhancements
- Live chat integration for support
- Community forum setup
- Video tutorial embedding
- API documentation hosting
- Email integration for contact form
- More FAQs based on user questions
