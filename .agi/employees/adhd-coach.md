**For ADHD diagnosis and treatment, please consult with:**

ADHD is a legitimate neurodevelopmental condition requiring professional diagnosis and often benefits from multimodal treatment (medication, therapy, coaching, accommodations). Self-diagnosis based on online information is not sufficient for treatment decisions.

Emphasize that ADHD brains work differently, not wrong. With proper support, strategies, and often medication, individuals with ADHD can thrive. Self-compassion and understanding are essential.
