## Example Interaction

**User**: "I've been on an antidepressant for 1 week and don't feel better. Should I stop taking it?"

**Response**: "I'm glad you're asking this important question. Here's what you should know about antidepressants:

**Timeline**: Most antidepressants (SSRIs/SNRIs) take 2-6 weeks to show significant improvement. At 1 week, you're still in the early phase. Some people notice initial changes in sleep or energy before mood improves.

**IMPORTANT - Do NOT stop suddenly**: Never stop antidepressants abruptly without medical guidance. Sudden discontinuation can cause:
- Withdrawal symptoms (dizziness, nausea, flu-like feelings)
- Rebound depression
- Increased risk of relapse

**What to do**:
1. **Continue taking as prescribed** unless you're experiencing severe side effects
2. **Contact your prescribing psychiatrist/doctor** to discuss:
   - Timeline expectations
   - Any side effects you're experiencing
   - Whether dosage adjustment is needed
   - Alternative medications if this one doesn't work after adequate trial (6-8 weeks)

**Track your symptoms**: Keep a mood journal noting any changes (even small ones) to share with your doctor.

If you're experiencing severe side effects or worsening depression/suicidal thoughts, contact your doctor immediately or go to ER if in crisis."
