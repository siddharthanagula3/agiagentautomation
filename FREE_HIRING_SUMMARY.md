# 🎉 Free AI Employee Hiring - Implementation Complete

## Overview
AI Employees are now **FREE** to hire! Users can instantly add any AI Employee to their workforce without payment.

## What Changed

### ✅ Marketplace (`src/pages/MarketplacePublicPage.tsx`)
- ✅ Removed Stripe checkout integration
- ✅ Changed button to "Hire for Free"
- ✅ Added "Free to Hire" badge with sparkles
- ✅ Direct instant hiring - no payment flow
- ✅ Toast notifications guide users to workforce page

### ✅ Workforce Page (`src/pages/workforce/WorkforcePage.tsx`)
- ✅ Removed Stripe success URL handling
- ✅ Removed manual purchase fallback logic
- ✅ Cleaned up unused imports

### ✅ Stripe Webhook (`netlify/functions/stripe-webhook.ts`)
- ✅ Removed AI Employee purchase handling
- ✅ Kept Pro/Max subscription handling
- ✅ Updated invoice events to only affect user subscriptions
- ✅ Removed purchased_employees table updates from subscription events

### ✅ Database
- ✅ Created `SETUP_FREE_HIRING.sql` script
- ✅ Table structure supports free hiring
- ✅ No Stripe subscription columns needed
- ✅ Simple user_id + employee_id relationship

## Monetization Model

### Free Tier
- ✅ **All AI Employees are FREE to hire**
- ✅ 1M total tokens (250k per LLM)
- ✅ Access to all features

### Pro Plan - $20/month
- ✅ 10M total tokens (2.5M per LLM)
- ✅ Priority support
- ✅ Advanced analytics
- ✅ Managed via Stripe subscription

### Max Plan - $299/month
- ✅ 40M total tokens (10M per LLM)
- ✅ Dedicated support
- ✅ Custom integrations
- ✅ White-label options

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User browses marketplace
2. Clicks "Hire for Free" button
3. AI Employee is **instantly added** to their workforce
4. User can start building immediately in `/vibe` page

### Technical Flow
```typescript
// When user clicks "Hire for Free"
await purchaseEmployee(user.id, employee);
// ↓
// Inserts into purchased_employees table
// ↓
// User sees employee in workforce immediately
```

### No Stripe Integration for Hiring
- ❌ No checkout session
- ❌ No webhooks for employees
- ❌ No subscription management for employees
- ✅ Just direct database insert

## Revenue Model
Revenue comes from **token usage subscriptions** (Pro/Max plans), not individual employee purchases.

### Why This Makes Sense
1. **Lower barrier to entry** - Users can try all employees
2. **Value-based pricing** - Pay for usage, not per employee
3. **Viral growth** - More users can experiment freely
4. **Natural upsell** - Heavy users upgrade for more tokens
5. **Simplified checkout** - Only 2 subscription tiers to manage
