## Example Response

**For "Can you explain quadratic equations?"**

```markdown
## Let's Learn: Quadratic Equations

### What You Asked

How to understand and solve quadratic equations

### Key Concept

A quadratic equation is any equation that can be written in the form:
**ax² + bx + c = 0**

Where:

- a, b, c are numbers (a ≠ 0)
- x is the variable we're solving for
- The highest power of x is 2 (that's what makes it "quadratic")

Think of it like this: You're trying to find which number(s), when you square them and do some math, equal zero.

### Let's Break It Down

**Step 1: Recognize the Standard Form**
ax² + bx + c = 0

Example: 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0

- a = 2 (coefficient of x²)
- b = 5 (coefficient of x)
- c = -3 (constant term)

**Step 2: Choose a Solution Method**

There are three main ways to solve:

1. **Factoring** (fastest when it works)
2. **Quadratic Formula** (always works)
3. **Completing the Square** (shows why formula works)

**Step 3: Solve Using Your Chosen Method**

### Example Problem: Solve x² + 5x + 6 = 0

**Method 1: Factoring**

1. Find two numbers that:
   - Multiply to give c (6)
   - Add to give b (5)

2. Those numbers are 2 and 3:
   - 2 × 3 = 6 ✓
   - 2 + 3 = 5 ✓

3. Write as factors:
   (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0

4. Set each factor to zero:
   - x + 2 = 0 → x = -2
   - x + 3 = 0 → x = -3

**Solutions: x = -2 or x = -3**

**Method 2: Quadratic Formula**

For any equation ax² + bx + c = 0:

x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

For our equation x² + 5x + 6 = 0:

- a = 1, b = 5, c = 6

x = [-5 ± √(5² - 4(1)(6))] / (2(1))
x = [-5 ± √(25 - 24)] / 2
x = [-5 ± √1] / 2
x = [-5 ± 1] / 2

So:

- x = (-5 + 1) / 2 = -4/2 = -2
- x = (-5 - 1) / 2 = -6/2 = -3

**Same solutions: x = -2 or x = -3** ✓

### Practice Problems

Try solving these:

**Easy**:

1. x² + 7x + 12 = 0 (hint: factor it)
2. x² - 4 = 0 (hint: difference of squares)

**Medium**: 3. 2x² + 7x + 3 = 0 (use quadratic formula) 4. x² + 6x + 9 = 0 (perfect square)

**Challenge**: 5. 3x² - 5x - 2 = 0

<details>
<summary>Answers (click to reveal)</summary>

1. x = -3 or x = -4
2. x = 2 or x = -2
3. x = -0.5 or x = -3
4. x = -3 (double root)
5. x = 2 or x = -1/3
</details>

### Quick Check ✓

- [ ] Can you identify a, b, and c in a quadratic equation?
- [ ] Do you know when to use factoring vs. formula?
- [ ] Can you solve a simple quadratic on your own?

### Pro Tips 💡

**For Factoring**:

- If c is positive: both numbers have same sign as b
- If c is negative: numbers have different signs
- Check your answer by expanding: (x + 2)(x + 3) = x² + 5x + 6 ✓

**Discriminant** (b² - 4ac) tells you:

- Positive: 2 real solutions
- Zero: 1 real solution (repeated root)
- Negative: No real solutions (complex numbers)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:

- Forgetting the ± in quadratic formula
- Sign errors (especially with negatives)
- Dividing by 2a, not just 2

### Memory Trick 🧠

For quadratic formula: **"x equals negative b, plus or minus square root, b squared minus 4ac, all over 2a"**

Sing it to "Pop Goes the Weasel" tune!

## Use Bash for Calculations

```bash
# Solve quadratic equation
python3 -c "
import math
a, b, c = 1, 5, 6
disc = b**2 - 4*a*c
x1 = (-b + math.sqrt(disc)) / (2*a)
x2 = (-b - math.sqrt(disc)) / (2*a)
print(f'Solutions: x1 = {x1}, x2 = {x2}')
"
```
