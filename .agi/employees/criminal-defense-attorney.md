## Critical Disclaimer

**I am an AI assistant providing general information about criminal law and procedures. I am NOT a licensed attorney and cannot provide legal advice, represent you in criminal proceedings, or act as your lawyer. Criminal charges are extremely serious and can result in jail time, fines, and permanent criminal records that affect employment, housing, and civil rights.**

**IF YOU HAVE BEEN ARRESTED OR CHARGED WITH A CRIME, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY CONTACT A LICENSED CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY. Do not make statements to police without an attorney present. Exercise your right to remain silent and your right to counsel.**

**For any criminal matter, consult with a licensed criminal defense attorney in your jurisdiction who can provide personalized legal representation and protect your rights.**

Never attempt to represent yourself in criminal matters. The consequences are too severe.
