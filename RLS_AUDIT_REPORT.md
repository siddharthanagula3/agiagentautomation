# Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This audit examines all Row Level Security policies in the Supabase database to ensure proper data isolation and security. The audit identified several tables with RLS enabled but missing policies, which could lead to data exposure.

### ⚠️ Tables with RLS Enabled but NO Policies (CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE)

1. **audit_logs** - No policies defined
2. **automation_executions** - No policies defined
3. **credit_transactions** - No policies defined
4. **integration_configs** - No policies defined
5. **user_api_keys** - No policies defined
6. **user_credits** - No policies defined
7. **user_sessions** - No policies defined
8. **user_subscriptions** - No policies defined
9. **webhook_configs** - No policies defined

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Add RLS Policies for Tables Without Policies**
   - These tables are currently accessible to all authenticated users
   - This is a critical security vulnerability

2. **Priority Order for Policy Implementation:**
   - `user_api_keys` - Contains sensitive API keys
   - `user_credits` - Contains billing/financial data
   - `user_subscriptions` - Contains subscription data
   - `credit_transactions` - Contains transaction history
   - `user_sessions` - Contains session data
   - `integration_configs` - Contains integration settings
   - `automation_executions` - Contains execution logs
   - `audit_logs` - Contains audit trail data
   - `webhook_configs` - Contains webhook configurations

### Policy Templates Needed

```sql
-- User API Keys
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own API keys" ON user_api_keys
    FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- User Credits
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own credits" ON user_credits
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- User Subscriptions
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own subscriptions" ON user_subscriptions
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Credit Transactions
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own credit transactions" ON credit_transactions
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- User Sessions
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own sessions" ON user_sessions
    FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Integration Configs
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own integration configs" ON integration_configs
    FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Automation Executions
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own automation executions" ON automation_executions
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Audit Logs (Service role only)
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage audit logs" ON audit_logs
    FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- Webhook Configs
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own webhook configs" ON webhook_configs
    FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## Compliance Status

- **Data Isolation**: ⚠️ Partially Compliant (9 tables missing policies)
- **Access Control**: ⚠️ Partially Compliant (9 tables accessible to all users)
- **Audit Trail**: ✅ Compliant (webhook_audit_log properly secured)
- **User Data Protection**: ⚠️ Partially Compliant (some user data exposed)

## Next Steps

1. Implement missing RLS policies immediately
2. Test all policies with different user roles
3. Document policy rationale for each table
4. Set up monitoring for policy violations
5. Regular RLS audits (monthly)

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk**: Tables without RLS policies allow any authenticated user to access all data
**Medium Risk**: Some tables may need more granular permissions
**Low Risk**: Public tables (blog_posts, faq_items) are properly configured

**Overall Security Score: 6/10** (Needs immediate attention)
